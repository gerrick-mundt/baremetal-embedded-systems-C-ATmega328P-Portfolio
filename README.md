Welcome to the baremetal-embedded-systems-C-Portfolio README!

# Purpose

This repository is a progressive portfolio of my embedded systems projects using the ATmega328P, built entirely in bare-metal C. My goal is to document and showcase my growth in low-level programming, hardware control, and embedded systems design. Every project here demonstrates increasing complexity and a deeper understanding of hardware and software interaction.

# Repository Structure

Each project is organized to clearly separate source code, build artifacts, and project outputs:

* Code - src (source files), build, Makefile
* Project Output

# How to use this wiki
This wiki serves as a guide to:

* Explore my embedded systems projects
* Understand the objectives and challenges of each project
* Review results, observations, and lessons learned

Each project page contains:

1. Project Overview – Goals, purpose, and functionality
2. Software Description – Software Used, Project Files
3. Hardware – Bill of Materials (BOM) used for the project
4. Project Functionality – Explanation of what code does and how hardware implements it
5. Outcomes – Did it work as intended?, challenges faced, lessons learned, project output
6. Project Progression - How this project compares to previous projects

# Project Progression

Projects are arranged to show increasing complexity and skills development. Example progression:

1. Beginner Projects - Basic GPIO manipulation, LED blinking, push-button input
2. Intermediate Project - Timers, interrupts, UART communication
3. Advanced Projects - SPI/I2C peripherals, sensor interfacing, multi-module projects
4. Complex Systems - Embedded systems integration, multiple-peripheral coordination RTOS basics

# Contributing

Currently, this repository is personal and maintained by me only.

* Anyone is welcome to view and fork the projects
* Pull requests will be reviewed selectively
* All original source code and outcomes are documented for learning purposes

# Goals of this Repository
* Track personal growth in bare-metal programming and embedded systems
* Build a professional portfolio demonstrating progressive skills
* Provide a reference for learning low-level programming concepts
